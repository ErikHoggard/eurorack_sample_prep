# eurorack_sample_prep
Pretty barebones right now, but still better than doing everything manually.
Currently supports ALM Squid Salmple, Make Noise Morphagene, and Expert Sleepers Disting mk4

USAGE: ./prep_files.sh .
Output files that already exist will be skipped. Use --force to re-convert and overwrite all output files.

#### TODO
add support for recursive/nested file structures


######## TODO (but yeah right)
UI for managing sample banks, reels, etc. for specific modules
